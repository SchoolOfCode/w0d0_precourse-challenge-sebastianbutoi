## Build a Tribute Page - freeCodeCamp


This is my second time going through the Responsive Web Design course from freeCodeCamp. I really enjoyed following the course and I had the chance to understand more things than the first time. I'm sure there is a lot more to improve and I will definetly keep working step by step.

My subject is **Nelson Mandela** who doesn't need any introduction. He has done a lot to help the people in his country and I believe he really deserves the place on my tribute page.
